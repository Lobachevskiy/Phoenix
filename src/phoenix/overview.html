        An unofficial Java clone/remake/port/patch of/for the game 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_the_Fading_Suns">Emperor of the Fading Suns (EFS)</a>.
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        An unofficial Java clone/remake/port/patch of/for the game 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_the_Fading_Suns">Emperor of the Fading Suns (EFS)</a>. 
        Uses original EFS data files and requires EFS 1.4 to be installed. Should work with all mods. All public classes,
        that is the main classes of the source files, should have at least one sentence of documentation in this API documentation 
        (note that this is not an API per se, but a documentation of the sources, as Phoenix is supposed to be a full
        application, minus the data files.)
        <h3>Program structure</h3>
            The source code is organized as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
            Main program entry point: class Phoenix in package phoenix
                <li>    
            Graphical user interface implementation: package gui
                <li>   
            State machine for controlling GUI: package state
                <li>    
            Most of game data structures and logic: package game
                <li>    
            Reading in and representing data in GALAXY.GAL-files: package galaxyreader
                <li>    
            Reading in and representing data in text mode data files: package dat
                <li>    
            Utility classes: package util
                <li>    
            Most of AI related data structures and logic (very much WIP): package ai
            </ul>
